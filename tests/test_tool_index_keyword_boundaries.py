"""Keyword-hint force-include must match on word boundaries, not substrings.

`get_tools_for_query` force-includes whole tool families when a query mentions
an intent keyword. The match used a raw substring test (`kw in ql`), so short
hints fired inside unrelated words: "fix" in "prefix", "line" in "deadline"/
"online", "serve" in "observe"/"reserve", "reply" in "replying", "unread" in
"unreadable". That bloated the tool set with irrelevant email/document/serve
tools for queries that have nothing to do with them. Same substring-vs-word
pitfall already fixed in topic_analyzer.py.

`retrieve` (which needs a chroma collection) is stubbed out so these tests
exercise only the keyword-hint loop.
